### Abstract
Background: The tripartite motif (TRIM) proteins function as important regulators in innate immunity, tumorigenesis, cell differentiation and ontogenetic development. However, we are still lack knowledge about the genetic and transcriptome alterations landscape of TRIM proteins across cancer types. 
Methods: We comprehensively reviewed and characterized the perturbations of TRIM genes across >10,000 samples across 33 cancer types. Genetic mutations and transcriptome of TRIM genes were analyzed by diverse computational methods. A TRIMs score index was calculated based on the expression of TRIM genes. The correlation between TRIMs scores and clinical associations, immune cell infiltrations and immunotherapy response were analyzed by correlation coefficients and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis.
Results: Alterations in TRIM genes and protein levels frequently emerge in a wide range of tumors and affect expression of TRIM genes. In particular, mutations located in domains are likely to be deleterious mutations. Perturbations of TRIM genes are correlated with expressions of immune checkpoints and immune cell infiltrations, which are further regulating the cancer- and immune-related pathways. Moreover, we proposed a TRIMs score index, which can accurately predict the clinical outcome of cancer patients. TRIMs scores of patients are correlated with clinical survival and immune therapy response across cancer types. Identifying the TRIM genes with genetic and transcriptome alterations will directly contribute to cancer therapy in the context of predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine.
Conclusions: Our study provided a comprehensive analysis and resource for guiding both mechanistic and therapeutic analyses of the roles of TRIM genes in cancer.
